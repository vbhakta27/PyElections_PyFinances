# PyElections & PyFinances - Python

## PyElections
I have been tasked with helping the city of Houston modernize its vote-counting process for the next mayoral elections. No candidate won a majority (over 50%) of the vote during the general election that took place on November 5, 2019. The 2019 Houston mayoral election was decided by a runoff on December 14, 2019 to elect the Mayor of Space City. 

Write a script that will decide the two candidates with the highest number of votes who will advance to the runoff election. I have been given a set of the last general election data called houston_election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Candidate, County, and Voter ID. The Python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- Prints the names of the two candidates who will advance to the runoff election.

## PyFinances
I have been tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I have been given set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Profit/Losses and Date. 

The Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
